This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000/next-album-deploy](http://localhost:3000/next-album-deploy) with your browser to see the result. If you want to see the result with [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) follow these steps:

1: go to next.config.json file and change the value of basePath from 'next-album-deploy' to ''

2: rebuild the project with executing this command:

```
npm run build
```

3: If you can't still see the page, execute 'npm run dev' command.

You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/index.js`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.
